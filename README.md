> **Envision Datathon Project** - Grey Market Detection and Analysis Solution

## 🎯 Project Overview

CodeLayers Presents a comprehensive data analysis solution developed for the Envision Datathon, focusing on detecting and analyzing grey market activities in e-commerce platforms. The project leverages machine learning and statistical techniques to identify suspicious seller behavior and counterfeit product distribution patterns.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Grey market activities pose significant challenges to legitimate e-commerce platforms:
- Unauthorized sellers distributing genuine products outside official channels
- Counterfeit products masquerading as authentic items
- Price manipulation and unfair competition
- Customer trust erosion and brand reputation damage

## 🚀 Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious seller patterns and listing behaviors
- **Price Analysis**: Detects abnormal pricing strategies indicative of grey market activities
- **Seller Profiling**: Analyzes seller reputation, feedback patterns, and transaction history
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visual insights into market trends and anomalies
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to flag high-risk listings
